- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

It allows us to methods from the Component Lifecycle.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Constructor: It's purpose in React as one that serves the component up with the initial state data that it needs to have during initial render.

Render: It's there to return what your component will render to the screen.

ComponentDidMound: This performs any asynchronous actions inside of our componentDidMount function, especially when it comes to fetching data via HTTP.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      So you don't use the same kind of hooks throughout you're application.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      Testing surfaces bugs faster, acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring and allows us to trust the code.
